# Roxie-Prototype
A quick prototype for a platform game. 
Contains code to load from .tmx files created with the tiled level editor, utilizing a C library for this purpose.
The game idea itself is a concept for a 2D platformer game deigned to be played on both PC with the mouse or iOS with the touch screen. This was a successful prototyping endeavor. I made it quickly and could see firsthand if the idea was fun. I have since changed a lot of these ideas because of the prototype and will use the data obtained for future iterations of this concept.
